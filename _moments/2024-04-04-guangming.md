Even though I've been living in Shenzhen for over 10 years, there are still many interesting places waiting to be explored. With my NSFC grant submitted and serendipitously finding myself with some free time during the Tomb-Sweeping Festival, I made the decision to venture to Hongqiao Park located in the Guangming District.

The highlight of the park, which is a bridge called "Hongqiao," is 4 kilometers long, 5 meters wide and 8 meters high. It starts from Xincheng Park in the west and connects Marathon Mountain and Lake Greenway in the east. The round trip of Hongqiao takes approximately 2 hours. For those who have been sedentary for a long time, this is a great place to relax on the weekend, as the so-called hiking here is definitely "painless".

For lunch, we opted for the nearby Guangming Hostel, where the squab, sweet corn and bovine colostrum are three things you have to eat.
