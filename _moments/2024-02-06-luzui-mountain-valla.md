Today's check-in is at Shenzhen's Luzui Mountain Villa, located in Yangmeikeng, Dapeng New District, Shenzhen. It is the easternmost resort in Shenzhen, with stunning mountain and sea views.

Along the 20-minute coastal road from the gate to valla, one can see the magnificent view and feel one's own insignificance.

Looking up, the sea meets the sky, blending into one color. With 360-degree panoramic sea views, the sea breeze blowing, one marvels at the beauty of nature that is so captivating that a few words can hardly describe the magnificent beauty here.
