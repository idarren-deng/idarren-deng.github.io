<br/>On the odd occasion, while looking up at the sky, one may notice a hazy rainbow-colored ring around the sun. This phenomenon is called a solar halo or 22-degree halo, but what exactly does it look like?

There was just a very beautiful solar halo in the sky over Shenzhen, and everyone in SIAT was busy taking pictures of such a rare and spectacular scene during lunch and sharing in their social media.
