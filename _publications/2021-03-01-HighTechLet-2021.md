To solve the issue that the existing soft rehabilitation gloves only with flexion/ extension function cannot provide full range motion support, which is not good for the rehabilitation of hand movement disorders caused by abnormal muscle tone after stroke. A new fiber-reinforced parallel cavity-type soft pneumatic actuator (SPA) is designed. The new SPA can realize three-dimensional actuation under 3-channel pressures, supporting complex motion of extension/flexion, abduction/ adduction and adduction/ abduction. In this research, first, based on the analysis of ac-tion elements of human hand, a SP A structure is designed, then design parameters are verified using a finite ele-ment analysis tool and kinematic modeling is also established. Then, the preparation method of SPA is given. Load tests of SPA and manipulation tasks of a fabricated soft glove are conducted. The results show that a glove with the designed SPAs can realize cooperative finger motions under complex actuation mode, and supports full range of finger motion assistance, which significantly improves patients' manipulation dexterity.
