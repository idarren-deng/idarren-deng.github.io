When a robot manipulator performs tasks in a dynamic unstructured environment, it not only should account for where and how it should move, but also ensure that the robot can effectively avoid collisions with static and moving obstacles. Planning in absolutely unstructured and dynamic environment is much more challenging, up-to-date there is no universal solution to this problem. In this paper, we believed the concept that for motion planning in real dynamic environments, usually there is only a part of a path invalidated by obstacles, and only this part needs replanning. Thus, in this paper a practical strategy was presented for motion planning in dynamic environments. First, a variant dynamic Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner was designed to combine global planning with local replanning. Then, the proposed dynamic RRT algorithm was implemented under Robotic Operation System (ROS) framework and applied to a 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator. Experimental results have shown that the proposed dynamic RRT planner can plan and execute movement of robot manipulator between a starting and target position while preserving task constraints and reacting to environment changes in real time.
