Visualized simulation has always been one of the most flexible techniques for quick verification of prototype or algorithms. In this paper, we illustrate a simple and effective method of how to implement the simulation of mobile manipulation task using Robot Operation System (ROS) with MoveIt. First, we propose a quick and modular architecture which includes the entire configuration process of system modeling, kinematics, control, and visualization. Then, we demonstrated its application on simulation of a mobile manipulation task in the automatic production line. Experimental results have shown that the proposed architecture achieves an easy configuration, a good integration and functional visualization for manipulation simulation.
