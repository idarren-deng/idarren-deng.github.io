This paper intends to create a simulation of manipulator and illustrates the methods of how to implement robot control in a short time. Here we complete the grasp and place mission using Gazebo virtual world and Robot Operating System (ROS). ROS is a distributed framework that is widely used in robotics. Considering the advantages of its easier hardware abstraction and code reuse, ROS was chosen to rapidly organize task architecture and, due to its compatibility with ROS, Gazebo was chosen as the main platform to simulate the designated motion of virtual manipulator.
